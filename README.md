This file includes some of the projects I having been working on during my internship at Codsoft.

First is the Credit Card Fraud Detection. Here we build a machine learning model(linear regression) to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. After pre-processing and normalizing the transaction data, we split the data for trainining and testing data. Finally the model's performance is evaluated using metrics.

Secondly, Sales Prediction Using Linear Regression. This project involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purcahse, taking into account various factors advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.

Finnally, Titanic Survival Prediction. This is a classic beginner project where we build a model that predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or  not. The dataset used containes information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket, class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
